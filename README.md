# Base Sepolia Farcaster MiniApp Template

The template demonstrates all Mini App capabilities and lets you easily modify it, so you can build Mini Apps on Base Sepolia testnet.

## Cloning the Template

You can use the following command to clone the Mini App template to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/harshshukla9/base-farcaster
```

### Install the dependencies

```
pnpm install
```

### Copy `.env.example` over to `.env.local`

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

### Run the template

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### View the App in Warpcast Embed tool

Warpcast has a neat [Embed tool](https://warpcast.com/~/developers/mini-apps/embed) that you can use to inspect the Mini App before you publish it.

Unfortunately, the embed tool can only work with remote URL. Inputting a localhost URL does not work.

As a workaround, you may make the local app accessible remotely using a tool like `cloudflared` or `ngrok`. In this guide we will use `cloudflared`.

#### Install Cloudflared

```bash
brew install cloudflared
```

For more installation options see the [official docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/).

#### Expose localhost

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
```

Be sure to specify the correct port for your local server.

#### Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_URL` environment variable in `.env.local` file

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=<url-from-cloudflared-or-ngrok>
```

#### Use the provided url

`cloudflared` will generate a random subdomain and print it in the terminal for you to use. Any traffic to this URL will get sent to your local server.

Enter the provided URL in the [Warpcast Embed tool](https://warpcast.com/~/developers/mini-apps/embed).

Let's investigate the various components of the template.

## Customizing the Mini App Embed

Mini App Embed is how the Mini App shows up in the feed or in a chat conversation when the URL of the app is shared.

The Mini App Embed looks like this:

![embed-preview](https://docs.base.org/img/guides/farcaster-miniapp/2.png)

You can customize this by editing the file `app/page.tsx`:

```js
...

const appUrl = env.NEXT_PUBLIC_URL;

const frame = {
  version: "next",
  imageUrl: `${appUrl}/images/feed.png`, // Embed image URL (3:2 image ratio)
  button: {
    title: "Template", // Text on the embed button
    action: {
      type: "launch_frame",
      name: "Base Sepolia Farcaster MiniApp Template",
      url: appUrl, // URL that is opened when the embed button is tapped or clicked.
      splashImageUrl: `${appUrl}/images/splash.png`,
      splashBackgroundColor: "#0052FF",
    },
  },
};

...
```

You can either edit the URLs for the images or replace the images in `public/images` folder in the template.

Once you are happy with the changes, click `Refetch` in the Embed tool to get the latest configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are developing locally, ensure that your Next.js app is running locally and the cloudflare tunnel is open. 

## Customizing the Splash Screen

Upon opening the Mini App, the first thing the user will see is the Splash screen:

![splash-screen](https://docs.base.org/img/guides/farcaster-miniapp/3.png)

You can edit the `app/page.tsx` file to customize the Splash screen.

```js
...

const appUrl = env.NEXT_PUBLIC_URL;

const frame = {
  version: "next",
  imageUrl: `${appUrl}/images/feed.png`,
  button: {
    title: "Launch Template",
    action: {
      type: "launch_frame",
      name: "Base Sepolia Farcaster MiniApp Template",
      url: appUrl,
      splashImageUrl: `${appUrl}/images/splash.png`, // App icon in the splash screen (200px * 200px)
      splashBackgroundColor: "#0052FF", // Splash screen background color (Base blue)
    },
  },
};

...
```

For `splashImageUrl`, you can either change the URL or replace the image in `public/images` folder in the template.

## Modifying the Mini App

Upon opening the template Mini App, you should see a screen like this:



The code for this screen is in the `components/pages/app.tsx` file:

```tsx
export default function Home() {
  const { context } = useMiniAppContext();
  return (
    // SafeAreaContainer component makes sure that the app margins are rendered properly depending on which client is being used.
    <SafeAreaContainer insets={context?.client.safeAreaInsets}>
      {/* You replace the Demo component with your home component */}
      <Demo />
    </SafeAreaContainer>
  )
}
```

You can remove or edit the code in this file to build your Mini App.

### Accessing User Context


Your Mini App receives various information about the user, including `username`, `fid`, `displayName`, `pfpUrl` and other fields.

The template provides a helpful hook `useMiniAppContext` that you can use to access these fields:

```js
export function User() {
    const { context } = useMiniAppContext();
    return <p>{context.user.username}</p>
}
```

The template also provide an example of the same in `components/Home/User.tsx` file.

You can learn more about Context [here](https://miniapps.farcaster.xyz/docs/sdk/context).

### Performing App Actions

![composeCast](https://docs.base.org/img/guides/farcaster-miniapp/composeCast.gif)

Mini Apps have the capability to perform native actions that enhance the user experience!

Actions like:

- `addFrame`: Allows the user to save (bookmark) the app in a dedicated section
- `composeCast`: Allows the MiniApp to prompt the user to cast with prefilled text and media
- `viewProfile`: Presents a profile of a Farcaster user in a client native UI



The template provides an easy way to access the actions via the `useMiniAppContext` hook!

```js
const { actions } = useMiniAppContext();
```

An example for the same can be found in `components/Home/FarcasterActions.tsx` file.

### Prompting Wallet Actions



Every user of Warpcast has access to various wallet integrations with Base Sepolia testnet support.

**Mini Apps can prompt the user to perform onchain actions on Base Sepolia**!

The template provides an example for the same in `components/Home/WalletActions.tsx` file.

```js
export function WalletActions() {
    ...

    async function sendTransactionHandler() {
        sendTransaction({
            to: "0x7f748f154B6D180D35fA12460C7E4C631e28A9d7",
            value: parseEther("0.001"), // Small amount for testnet
        });
    }

    ...
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> The wallet supports multiple networks. It is recommended that you ensure that Base Sepolia is connected before prompting wallet actions.

You can use viem's `switchChain` or equivalent to prompt a chain switch.

```js
// Switching to Base Sepolia
switchChain({ chainId: 84532 });
```

The template has an example for the same in the `components/Home/WalletActions.tsx` file.

## Base Sepolia Network Configuration

This template is configured to work with Base Sepolia testnet. Here are the network details:

- **Chain ID**: 84532
- **Network Name**: Base Sepolia
- **RPC URL**: https://sepolia.base.org
- **Block Explorer**: https://sepolia.basescan.org
- **Testnet Faucet**: https://www.coinbase.com/faucets/base-ethereum-goerli-faucet

### Getting Testnet ETH

To test wallet functionality, you'll need testnet ETH on Base Sepolia:

1. Visit the [Base Sepolia Faucet](https://www.coinbase.com/faucets/base-ethereum-goerli-faucet)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Request testnet ETH
4. Wait for the transaction to complete

pnpm lint

# Type checking
pnpm type-check
```

## Modifying the `farcaster.json` file

When publishing the Mini App you will need to have a `farcaster.json` file that follows the specification.

You can edit the `app/.well-known/farcaster.json/route.ts` file with your app details before publishing the app!

```ts
...

const appUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_URL;
const farcasterConfig = {
    // accountAssociation details are required to associated the published app with it's author
    accountAssociation: {
        "header": "",
        "payload": "",
        "signature": ""
    },
    frame: {
        version: "1",
        name: "Base Sepolia Farcaster MiniApp Template",
        iconUrl: `${appUrl}/images/icon.png`, // Icon of the app in the app store
        homeUrl: `${appUrl}`, // Default launch URL
        imageUrl: `${appUrl}/images/feed.png`, // Default image to show if shared in a feed.
        screenshotUrls: [], // Visual previews of the app
        tags: ["base", "sepolia", "farcaster", "miniapp", "template", "testnet"], // Descriptive tags for search
        primaryCategory: "developer-tools",
        buttonTitle: "Launch Template",
        splashImageUrl: `${appUrl}/images/splash.png`, // URL of image to show on loading screen.
        splashBackgroundColor: "#0052FF", // Base blue color for loading screen.
    }
};

...
```

You can learn more about publishing the Mini App and other manifest properties [here](https://miniapps.farcaster.xyz/docs/guides/publishing).
